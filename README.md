# Introduction : Reader Insights with Wikipedia
## The Idea
You're a news agency or a freelance writer. You already know what the big news story of the day is - e.g. David Bowie passing away. There are so many angles you could potentially write about, but which one to pick? Ideally, you would peek inside the mind of (a lot of) your audience and find out "What angle about this do they find interesting right now? What do they want to know more about?"

Clickstream data can give insights into this. When people want to know more about something, they look it up (e.g. on Wikipedia). Then they click on other pages telling them more about the angle they find most useful or interesting.

What if we could make all those clicks visible? It would give content writers a window into the minds of readers - show the flow of their interests, their ‘stream of consciousness’ e.g. recently, when the news broke that David Bowie passed away, what could Wikipedia clickstream data tell us about the topics that people were finding interesting relating to David Bowie? What other pages were they reading that led them there and what pages on the David Bowie page did they find interesting enough to click on next?
